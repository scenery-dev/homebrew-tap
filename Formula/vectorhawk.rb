    # Install the login-time daemon (LaunchAgent on macOS, systemd user unit on
    # Linux).  On Linux the Homebrew sandbox may not have an active D-Bus
    # session, so systemctl --user calls fail with "No medium found".  Both
    # daemon install and mcp setup can trigger this; both are non-fatal because
    # the systemd unit file is still written and will activate on next login.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      VectorHawk is ready.

      Next steps:
        1. Restart Claude Code (quit and reopen).
        2. Call the vectorhawk_login tool to authenticate.
        3. Browse and install skills in the portal, or use the vectorhawk_search
           / vectorhawk_install MCP tools. Installed skills appear as usual in
           Claude Code's skills list.

      If Claude Code was not configured automatically (e.g. install ran over
      SSH without a D-Bus session), run once in your normal login shell:
        vectorhawk mcp setup

      To uninstall cleanly:
        vectorhawk mcp remove
        vectorhawk daemon uninstall
        brew uninstall vectorhawk
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "vectorhawk", shell_output("#{bin}/vectorhawk --version")
  end
end
